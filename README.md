# Project Euler

An attempt to solve all Project Euler challenges in C, partly for fun and also
as a way of re-learning the language.

These are not necessarily the most efficient, elegant or robust solutions.

C99 is assumed and all solutions have been compiled with at least:

```
clang -Wall -Wextra -Werrors ${EX_NUM}.c -o ${EX_NUM}
```

Additional flags may have been used, e.g. if the solution includes the `math.h`
header or [glib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/).
