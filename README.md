# Project Euler

An attempt to solve all Project Euler challenges in C, partly for fun and also
as a way of re-learning the language.

These are not necessarily the most efficient, elegant or robust solutions.

C99 is assumed and all soutions have been compiled with:

```
clang -Weverything ${EX_NUM}.c -o ${EX_NUM}
```
